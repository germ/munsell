Munsell: Because Hex codes are not meant for humans.

[https://godoc.org/github.com/germ/munsell](GoDoc)

MunsellPicker is a simple way to transform sRGB colours into Munsell references and back again. Turns out, RGB is terrible for humans to wrangle their head around.

The Munsell system deconstructs a colour into three components, itâ€™s Hue, Value and Chromacity. The only difference between 5P 5/10 and 5P 6/10, is one level of Value, the other two factors are left untouched! A little useful.

Anyway, thanks for checking this grease out.
